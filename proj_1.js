  //a turn is that switch function business
var turn = function() {

    //if player === X when function turn() is executed, player === O
    //if player === 0 when function turn() is executed, player === X

//determining winner
  //when all three squares belonging to a class all evaluate to the same value (x, o), the player behind that value WINS; that game is over.
    //else if squares_filled = 9, it's a tie
      //create a squares-filled counter, added to w each click of a square.
